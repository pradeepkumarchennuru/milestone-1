# GitHub Workflows

*A collection of useful generic [GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)*

## About

You can find all workflows in [`.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/jessesquires/gh-workflows/tree/main/.github/workflows).

Each workflow contains comments explaining what it does. Most should be self-explanatory.

Workflows are developed and tested at [jessesquires/sandbox-gh-workflows](https://github.com/jessesquires/sandbox-gh-workflows) to keep this repo history clean.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**
>
> - Some workflows require adding a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
> - Some workflows expect specific labels to exist, as these are what trigger the workflow. You'll need to create these labels in your repo. If you name the labels differently, you will need to edit the workflow accordingly.
